# Docker

## Each images
In each directory, there are basically Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile shows which app should be install
- docker-compose.yml mainly shows for my case which dir should be mounted

## How to use
- I usually use with vscode
    - open vscode
    - select directory 
    - Click left bottom and slect Open folder in container
    - Then select docker-compose.yml => then open container in vscode, might be need to reload
    - When we use c++, from left side, we need to get c++ nuget in each container.
